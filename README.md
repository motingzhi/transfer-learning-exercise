# transfer-learning-exercise

The advanced task of deep learning part - apply transfer learning

1. Build CNN model that is able to recognize RGB gesture images
2. Randomly select 20 hand gestures and use these gestures to train the pre-trained model for
later transfer learning.
3. Perform transfer learning with the rest 6 unseen hand gestures (detailed steps: remove the
current output layer, add trainable layers, freeze layers, and fine-tune the whole model).
4. Test the new model using unseen test dataset, and report the accuracy.
